Aimed at ages 18-25, the 1-2 minute game offers a quick look into the life of a  refugee artist. It is a short game to learn about the artist, refugee Marc Chagall, play a short game of finding the paintbrush in the Art Gallery and then paint a picture.

## Project Brief

This project was one of several small projects during my internship with BIZGEES. The brief:

* Select a celebrity who was a refugee.

* Compile the information and background.

* Create a short 30 second - 2 minute game aimed at age group 18 -25.

* The game is to allow the player to learn about the refugee.

* Use AI to aid the creation.

I chose the artist Marc Chagall.

## Technologies used

For the project the aim was to use AI, mainly Rosebud AI (https://play.rosebud.ai/home)

On the platform a developer can clone games created by other developers and change them for their own purpose. 

I chose to use a game called Find the magic monkey, Evolved from: 2D Playground
Created by: radio_biscuit.

Although Rosebud can generate AI images, I found mine in a free image app and from images I had taken. 
Rosebud also allows the AI chat to change code.

For the painting scene game I created this in VS code and added it to the game.
